## Dashboard Enhancement: Dynamic Filters

### What We Built
Added dynamic filtering system to the clinical sites dashboard:

1. **Company/Drug Filter**
   - Artiva Biotherapeutics
   - Cullinan Oncology (CLN-978)
   - Candid Therapeutics
   - Amgen (Blinatumomab)

2. **Disease/Condition Filter** (NEW)
   - Dynamically populates based on selected company
   - Shows all unique diseases from current dataset
   - Sorted alphabetically
   - "All Diseases" option to show everything

### How It Works
- Select company → disease filter updates with that company's diseases
- Select disease → map and table filter to show only sites studying that disease
- Stats (Studies, Sites, Countries) update in real-time
- Filters reset appropriately when switching companies

### Technical Implementation
- Updated CSS for filter styling (blue for company, green for disease)
- Added `populateDiseaseFilter()` function to build disease dropdown
- Added `filterByDisease()` function to filter sites by condition
- Modified `switchProgram()` to reset disease filter and repopulate options
- Bound event listeners for both filters
- Header now flexbox with wrapping for mobile responsiveness
